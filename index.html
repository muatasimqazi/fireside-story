     <p>It was a dark and stormy night.</p>
     <p>The storm had knocked out the power in the village. The sounds of trees resisting the speedy winds were akin to scores of dogs howling incessantly.</p>
     <p>There was no at the house except me.</p>
     <p>Everybody else had gone out of town.</p>
